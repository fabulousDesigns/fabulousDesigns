## EDUCATION
#### B.s.D Computer Technology
My educational experience includes my undergraduate college degree- which contributes greatly to my development of skills such as `SEO` and `Fullstack web development`. The classes I take and projects I have completed are for a Computer Science major - and have imparted many of the concepts necessary to understand good web development techniques. I also often work to complete presentations with classmates- and this helps me hone my ability to collaborate constructively. My educational background has prepared me well for a successful career path. I also plan to pursue further coursework in the future in order to keep learning and gain the qualifications to advance in this field.
